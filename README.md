## Introduction
 
`PodTrader` is a platform designed for developing and executing quantitative trading strategies. It uses a three-tier architecture—Indicators, Signals, and Rules—so you can easily create, backtest, and manage sophisticated trading logic through a user-friendly graphical interface. By supporting multiple markets and asset classes, PodTrader allows you to seamlessly integrate cross-market relationships, custom indicators, capital allocation, and risk control strategies into an automated trading system.
 
The goal of this repo is to democratize access to advanced trading methodologies, allowing users of all skill levels to explore, create, and test their own trading strategies. By enabling individuals to customize indicators based on various advanced metrics, we strive to break down the barriers traditionally faced by novice traders.
